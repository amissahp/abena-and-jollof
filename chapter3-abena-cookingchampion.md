"Whats wrong Abena, you've been quiet since you came, even when we was doing detty detty" you didn't seem enthusiastic".
Said Sugar daddy Mike.

My boyfriend left me, he left me for my friend and to top it off, he said I can't cook," said Abena.
Well to be honest i married fell in love my wife after I tasted her cooking skills, I mean, it might sound silly to you
but I'm a sucker for good food, and I'm sorry to say, I have tasted you food and it is not great at all. I'm even
surprised that you mother is a well reknown chef yet her daughter can't cook. Didn't she give you cooking lessons growing
up?" said Mike. She did but I never paid attention I guess I was too lazy and occupied with other things, cooking isn't 
everything you know, like why can't men cook too?" replied Abena.
"Some men do but don't compare yourself to a man, it's not everyday why can't men, why can't men, you ladies like to scream.
Go back home and learn how to cook and be a cooking champion. Said Mike
