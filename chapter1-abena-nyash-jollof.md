It was bright sunny day in Kumasi, Ghana, and the beginning of mango season, the children were or break from school 
for Easter and as usual being a nuisance to their parents.

Watching the children go by through their kitchen window was Abena and her Mother Serwaa, "It seemed like just the 
other day you was like that, but now you're a beautiful lady, the most beautiful in Ghana", said Serwaa. "Thank you mum,
I take after you".
"Abena, you know im a chef, when are going to take my cooking lessons seriously? "I have been trying to teach you for 
years but you won't take it seriously, don't you know a man needs to eat good food, your pretty face and big bum bum
won't keep him at home ooo", said Serwaa.
"Mum you always say this, but I'm an independant lady, with one more year of University and I already have a good
job linedup from Kwame "No Size", after I finish", replied Abena "yo, said Serwaa you will see, anyway, leave me to 
finish this jollof" "great maame, you know your jollof is the best, I can't wait to take a bite, said Abena as she 
walked off with her tundra sized backside.

Abena was a beautiful girl from a town in called Bantama in Kumasi, Ghana. She was 20 years old curveaceous, with smooth
dark skin and flowing natural hair, all the men in the town and university wanted her, she was hot property.

Later on in the day, Abena started to pack her things and get ready to take a flight Accra, She was still on break from school, 
but one of the wealthiest guys were in town after being away in China conducting business. He and Abena had been dating for a
while and even though he was married Abena did not care. She loved the high life and could not wait to see him in Accra.
