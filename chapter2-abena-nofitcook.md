Life seemed great for Abena, she was doing well in university, had a job lined up after she graduated, had one of the richest
men in Accra eating from the palm of her hands, and a boyfriend who supported and loved her dearly.
As she sat down at Kumasi airport waiting to board her flight, she got a text message from her boyfriend, Edem. 
"Call me it said". "ohh what does this boy want, every time I'm going to see my sugar daddy this boy calls me, it's as if he
can sense it", Abena thought. She did not answer, but texted back saying she is about to board the plane and her brother is
picking her up as planned, so there is no need to get Razak to meet her at the airport".

This girl thinks I'm stupid, I know what she is doing, but I don't I have been chopping her best friend and eating real food
not that shit food she always cooks, like how can your mother be a chef and you cook nonsense like that. Thought Edem.
"Damn i'll miss that ass though, but fuck it, peace of mind and good food is better than any nyash", he said to himself.


When Abena landed, her sugar daddy's chaffeur was there to pick her up, "Hello Abena", he said as he opened the door to the
Lambourgini Urus.

"Hi" said Abena. She sat in the car, turned on her phone and within a second of doing that a text came through.
She opened it and her eyes lit up and her body felt hot like she had tasted the hottest kpakpa shito.
"Kwasia girl, you tink say I nor know say you get sugar daddy for Accra, you tink say I nor know he dey
chop you basa basa. You no get sense, because of money you dey open nyash, but its ok, You no fit cook anything
your cooking na trash, and thats why I have been dating Sandra behind your back, she is a fine girl who can cook and 
truth be told after eating her food I fell for her,God willing if all goes well I go propose to am next month, good bye".

Abena was stunned, I've been caught out, my boyfriend has left me for my best friend, and my cooking is bad,
just like my mum said.
